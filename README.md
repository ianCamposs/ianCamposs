### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

Master in computer science and passionate about technology.
I work with back end development using Node.js since 2018. In my day I look for solutions using the theoretical and practical knowledge I learned during my academic and professional experience, in special applying software quality concepts and software architecture to seek testable and high-impact solutions for the project.
